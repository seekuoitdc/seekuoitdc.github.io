Tomorrow, from 3:30PM to 5:30PM in ERC1096 we will be running a workshop on development with an Arduino microcontroller. This event is for everyone
and no previous experience is required. We will explain everything needed to begin writing programs for the Arduino
as well as interacting with hardware in order to build systems which interact with their physical environment.
Registration is not needed - just show up. Hope to see you there!
