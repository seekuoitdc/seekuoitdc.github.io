This Wednesday \(March 16th 3:30PM - 6:30PM\), SEEK will be hosting a guest presenter for a workshop on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
Anyone is encouraged to come, but some programming experience would definitely be helpful. Bring your laptop as you will need to
connect to *Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio*. Location for this workshop is ERC1094. Food and refreshments will be provided as well as
a challenge at the end of the workshop with a chance to win some swag (mouse, keyboard, etc...) Hope to see you there!
