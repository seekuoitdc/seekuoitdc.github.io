Tomorrow \(October 3rd 2:00PM - 3:00PM\), SEEK will be running its first workshop for the 2016 - 2017 year. The topic is Introduction to Linux.
We will cover fixing the broken Ubuntu image installed on the UOIT engineering laptops and connecting to CAMPUS-AIR. In addition we will cover
the basics of using Linux, and automating work with Linux shell scripting. Those who do not have Linux on their laptops are still welcome to
come and we will assist in creating a Linux Virtual Machine (VM) for learning Linux. Location for this event is J102 (Simcoe Building)
Hope to see you there!
