Tomorrow (March 23rd), in ERC1094 from 3:30PM to 5:30PM, SEEK will be running a workshop on software deployment with Docker.
For those who do not know what Docker is, it's a set of software tools which allow a developer to quickly deploy a software service
(often a web service). For example, start with someone else's already-created Apache image, modify it with your code
(for example your website) and then deploy it on any server. It's like a VM, but without virtualizing an entire computer - instead
it just wraps your software deployment in a container where it can be shipped and ran anywhere. Everyone is welcome.
There will be demos and an opportunity for students to try deploying their own service with Docker. Hope to see you there.
