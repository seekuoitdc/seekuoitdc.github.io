seekuoitdc.github.io has been recently updated with a [resources](/resources) section. This is the section of our website dedicated to helping
students find resources related to their software and electronic projects on and around the UOIT/DC campus. Special thanks to one
of our members, Tadeasko, for creating the awesome [picture map](/resources/techstore.html).
