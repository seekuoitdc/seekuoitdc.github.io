Tomorrow \(March 20th 12:30PM - 2:00PM\), SEEK will be running a workshop on the fundamentals of computer vision and its applications.
We will discuss how to build algorithms which will allow a computer to "see" things within a video feed or picture. We will also introduce
students to the popular OpenCV library which provides many of the methods needed for building Computer Vision algorithms. It is highly
recommended that students wishing to try OpenCV development have a working Linux image \(such as the one we setup in our Fall 2016 Intro to
Linux event\) as OpenCV is simplest to setup on Linux. Location for this event is J121-A.
Hope to see you there!
