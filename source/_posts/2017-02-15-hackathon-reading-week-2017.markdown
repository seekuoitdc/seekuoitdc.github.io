Ready to combine experiential learning with friendly competition? Join the Hackathon; a week full of collaborative programming, innovation
and prizes! Open to all students, participants will work in groups of 4 or less \(this includes solo work\) to build their projects and
demonstrate them on the presentation day \(TBA - Based on the availability of participants\). 
The sign-up form can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBI-jNmhFrH-50owFQ6dbGKdUAQg_cqbtdIlTAAuYRJUUfpw/viewform).

####Q & A####

- Q: When are the meetings?

A: The only official meeting is presentation day (TBA). Group members must decide how they will collaborate with each other on their projects.

- Q: Does my project need to be both software and hardware based?

A: Nope. You're free to build a software-only project or hardware-only project. You may also build a hardware/software project.

- Q: I want to involve electronic hardware in my project but I don't have any. What can I do?

A: Brilliant is running a Boot Camp on developing a technical design over the reading week \(Feb. 21 - 23\). They will have 10 Arduino kits for students to use and keep.
The project which students build at the Boot Camp may also be used for the hackathon. Check out Brilliant's event at [www.faststartfs.ca/bootcamp2017](http://www.faststartfs.ca/bootcamp2017).

- Q: Any other ways to get electronic parts?

A: Yes. SEEK has electronic parts available for borrowing at the library. Ask about this in the \#hackathon channel on [Slack](https://seekuoitdc.slack.com) and we will make
sure you are able to borrow parts for the duration of the hackathon.

- Q: What is the level of complexity of the projects?

A: More advanced projects will be scored higher, but all levels of complexity will be accepted.

- Q: Can I re-use an old project?

A: You may only present new content \(created during the reading week\). So if you're extending an old project, you will only be graded based on the modifications that took place during the hackathon.

- Q: Are there prizes for the winning teams?

A: You bet! Prizes will be awarded to the 1st and 2nd place winners.

- Q: Where can I find out more information?

A: The quickest way would be to send us a message on the \#hackathon channel on [Slack](https://seekuoitdc.slack.com). You can also message our Facebook [page](https://www.facebook.com/seek.uoitdc) or send us an email.


Finally a big thank you to the [UOIT Engineering Students Society](https://www.facebook.com/uoitengsoc), [Brilliant Entrepreneurship](https://www.facebook.com/uoitbrilliant), and the [UOIT IEEE Student chapter](https://www.facebook.com/IEEEStudentBranchUOIT) for helping us make this possible.

Hope to see you there!
