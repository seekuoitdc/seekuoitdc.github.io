Tomorrow \(November 16th 5:10PM - 6:30PM\), SEEK will be running its second workshop for the 2016 - 2017 year. We will be covering designing a
website using the Bootstrap framework. Bootstrap is a framework for designing a website so that it is presented properly on a wide variety of
screens \(laptops, tablets, phones, etc.\). In addition to designing a website with Bootstrap, if time permits, we will cover using Bootstrap
templates as well as compiling Bootstrap 4 from its SASS code. Location for this event is ERC1092.
Hope to see you there!
