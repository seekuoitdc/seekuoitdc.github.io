    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ready to combine experiential learning with friendly competition? Join the Hackathon; a week full of collaborative programming, innovation
and prizes! Open to all students, participants will work in groups of 4 or less (this includes solo work) to build their projects and
demonstrate them on the presentation day (TBA - Based on the availability of participants).
The sign-up form can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBI-jNmhFrH-50owFQ6dbGKdUAQg_cqbtdIlTAAuYRJUUfpw/viewform">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Q &amp; A</h4>

<ul>
<li>Q: When are the meetings?</li>
</ul>


<p>A: The only official meeting is presentation day (TBA). Group members must decide how they will collaborate with each other on their projects.</p>

<ul>
<li>Q: Does my project need to be both software and hardware based?</li>
</ul>


<p>A: Nope. You&rsquo;re free to build a software-only project or hardware-only project. You may also build a hardware/software project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Q: I want to involve electronic hardware in my project but I don&rsquo;t have any. What can I do?</li>
</ul>


<p>A: Brilliant is running a Boot Camp on developing a technical design over the reading week (Feb. 21 - 23). They will have 10 Arduino kits for students to use and keep.
The project which students build at the Boot Camp may also be used for the hackathon. Check out Brilliant&rsquo;s event at <a href="http://www.faststartfs.ca/bootcamp2017">www.faststartfs.ca/bootcamp2017</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Q: Any other ways to get electronic parts?</li>
</ul>


<p>A: Yes. SEEK has electronic parts available for borrowing at the library. Ask about this in the #hackathon channel on <a href="https://seekuoitdc.slack.com">Slack</a> and we will make
sure you are able to borrow parts for the duration of the hackathon.</p>

<ul>
<li>Q: What is the level of complexity of the projects?</li>
</ul>


<p>A: More advanced projects will be scored higher, but all levels of complexity will be accepted.</p>

<ul>
<li>Q: Can I re-use an old project?</li>
</ul>


<p>A: You may only present new content (created during the reading week). So if you&rsquo;re extending an old project, you will only be graded based on the modifications that took place during the hackathon.</p>

<ul>
<li>Q: Are there prizes for the winning teams?</li>
</ul>


<p>A: You bet! Prizes will be awarded to the 1st and 2nd place winners.</p>

<ul>
<li>Q: Where can I find out more information?</li>
</ul>


<p>A: The quickest way would be to send us a message on the #hackathon channel on <a href="https://seekuoitdc.slack.com">Slack</a>. You can also message our Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/seek.uoitdc">page</a> or send us an email.</p>

<p>Finally a big thank you to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uoitengsoc">UOIT Engineering Students Society</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uoitbrilliant">Brilliant Entrepreneurship</a>, and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IEEEStudentBranchUOIT">UOIT IEEE Student chapter</a> for helping us make this possible.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow (November 16th 5:10PM - 6:30PM), SEEK will be running its second workshop for the 2016 - 2017 year. We will be covering designing a
website using the Bootstrap framework. Bootstrap is a framework for designing a website so that it is presented properly on a wide variety of
screens (laptops, tablets, phones, etc.). In addition to designing a website with Bootstrap, if time permits, we will cover using Bootstrap
templates as well as compiling Bootstrap 4 from its SASS code. Location for this event is ERC1092.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thank you to everyone who came out to our Introduction to Linux workshop last Monday. As promised, <a href="http://seekuoitdc.github.io/2016_intro_linux_workshop/presentation.html">here</a>
are the slides from the presentation. For the people who were unable to log back into their Ubuntu user account after installing updates, one of our
members, who had this problem, was able to fix it through the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Select advanced options when booting Ubuntu (The same option we used for creating the user account)</p></li>
<li><p>Start linux in recovery mode (Exactly how we created the user account )</p></li>
<li><p>In the recovery menu choose <em>dpkg repair broken packages</em></p></li>
<li><p>You will be asked if you allow the root filesystem to be remounted as read/write, choose <em>yes</em></p></li>
<li><p>Dpkg will then begin repairing broken packages (which resulted from the failed update), this may take some time.</p></li>
<li><p>When this is complete you will be back at the recovery menu. Choose <em>resume</em> and Ubuntu should now work normally.</p></li>
<li><p>On all subsequent reboots, start Ubuntu normally (without going into advanced options)</p></li>
</ol>

    <updated>2016-03-22T18:22:02+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://seekuoitdc.github.io/blog/2016/03/22/docker-workshop</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow (March 23rd), in ERC1094 from 3:30PM to 5:30PM, SEEK will be running a workshop on software deployment with Docker.
For those who do not know what Docker is, it&rsquo;s a set of software tools which allow a developer to quickly deploy a software service
(often a web service). For example, start with someone else&rsquo;s already-created Apache image, modify it with your code
(for example your website) and then deploy it on any server. It&rsquo;s like a VM, but without virtualizing an entire computer - instead
it just wraps your software deployment in a container where it can be shipped and ran anywhere. Everyone is welcome.
There will be demos and an opportunity for students to try deploying their own service with Docker. Hope to see you there.</p>
